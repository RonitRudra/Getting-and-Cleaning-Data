####File Description
<ol> 
1. [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/RonitRudra/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/run_analysis.R): This is an R script file which performs merging,transformation and cleaning up of the [UCI HAR Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) . This script outputs a tidy dataset which has average values for the chosen variables per subject per activity.

2. [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/RonitRudra/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/CodeBook.md) : This is a markdown file which describes all the variables with units as well as the steps and transformations performed on the dataset.

3. [Avg_Tidy_Data.txt](https://github.com/RonitRudra/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/Avg_Tidy_Data.txt) : This is the txt file output of the `run_analysis.R` script.
This data set follows all the principles of tidy data namely:
  + Each variable occupies only one column
  + Each instance occupies only one row
  + Each column has a descriptive variable name
</ol>
